        Add ImageButton with id "edit_basic_info" here.
        Set its image (using android:src attribute) to a pencil.
        How do we import image asset for the pencil? Check out the slides!
        What should its width and height be?

        Add TextView with id "email" here.
        Set its text to a random email.

        Add ImageView with id "user_picture" here.
        Set its image (using android:src attribute) to any picture you want.
        What should its width and height be?

        Whatever picture you want to use, you will need to import first.
        Check out the slides for how to import custom pictures.

        TODO 5: Organize 4 views using LinearLayout
        Organize the 4 views (name, edit_basic_info, email, user_picture) using 3 nested LinearLayout.
        [1] put name and edit_basic_info into a LinearLayout with orientation "horizontal".
        [2] put LinearLayout in [1] and email into a LinearLayout with orientation "vertical".
        [3] put LinearLayout in [2] and user_picture into a LinearLayout with orientation "horizontal".

        How to position user_picture to the right most? Check out "layout_weight" in the slides!

        TODO 6: UI polish!
        Does the UI look weird after you have finished the 5 todos?
        Maybe add some padding (16dp recommended) to the root LinearLayout :)

        Best practice:
        It's best to put the padding value (or any other size constant, like the size of user_picture)
        into res/values/dimens.xml. Check out 2_main_ui branch to see how to do that.

        If your res/values folder doesn't contain dimens.xml, you can simply create one by right
        click on res folder -> New -> Android resource file -> File name: dimens -> OK
